# Content-Based-_Machine-Learning_for_Movie-Recommendation-System-Machine-Learning
Description:- A machine learning project focused on building a content-based movie recommendation system using Python and machine learning techniques.

Contents: Processed TMDB movie dataset consisting of 10,000 movies and feature Extraction. Generated recommendations using cosine similarity through machine learning techniques. Developed a user-friendly GU using the Streamlit library in Python. Implemented content-based filtering based on user preferences to enhance
Overview of the project and its objectives.
1.Data Collection: Description of the dataset used for building the recommendation system. Steps taken to collect and preprocess the data.
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analysis of the dataset to gain insights into movie attributes and user preferences. Visualization of key statistics and distributions.
3.Feature Engineering: Creation of features based on movie attributes (e.g., genres, cast, director, keywords). Transformation of data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
4.Building the Recommendation System: Implementation of content-based machine learning algorithms for generating movie recommendations. Evaluation of recommendation quality using relevant metrics.
5.Deployment: Steps to deploy the recommendation system for real-world usage. using the streamlit library  for created GUI .
